What is a firewall?
A security tool, hardware or software that is used to filter network traffic by stopping unauthorized incoming and outgoing traffic.

Traffic flows into and out of devices via what we call ports. 
A firewall is what controls what is - and more importantly isn't - allowed to pass through those ports.
You can think of it like a security guard standing at the door, checking the ID of everything that tries to enter or exit

Per Microsoft, "Windows Firewall offers three firewall profiles: domain, private and public".

Domain - The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
Private - The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
Public - The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.

If you were connected to airport Wi-Fi, what most likely will be the active firewall profile? (Public network)
