The System Configuration utility (MSConfig) is for advanced troubleshooting,
and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 

The utility has five tabs across the top. Below are the names for each tab. 
We will briefly cover each tab in this task. 
General
Boot
Services
Startup
Tools

In the General tab, we can select what devices and services for Windows to load upon boot.
The options are: Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective. 

In the Boot tab, we can define various boot options for the Operating System. 

The Services tab lists all services configured for the system regardless of their state (running or stopped).
A service is a special type of application that runs in the background.

There is a list of various utilities (tools) in the Tools tab here that we can run to configure the operating system further.
There is a brief description of each tool to provide some insight into what the tool is for.
