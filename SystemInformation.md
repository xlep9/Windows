What is the System Information (msinfo32) tool?
Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  
This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware,
system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues.

Per Microsoft, "Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. 
This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders.

The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs.
For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory.
Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located".
