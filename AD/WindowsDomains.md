 a Windows domain is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralise the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called Active Directory (AD). The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a Domain Controller (DC).

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:

- Centralised identity management: All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.

- Managing security policies: You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.
