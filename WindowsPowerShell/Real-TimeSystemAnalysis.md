PowerShell provides advanced tools to analyze running processes, services, and active network connections.

Common Commands:

Get-Process: Lists running processes (similar to tasklist in CMD).

Get-Service: Shows services and their statuses (similar to net start in CMD).

Get-NetTCPConnection: Displays active TCP connections (like netstat in CMD).

example:

Service: WinDefend -> Process: MsMpEng.exe -> Network: connect update
