PowerShell can retrieve detailed system and network information, similar to CMD and Linux, but in a more structured way.

Common Commands:

Get-ComputerInfo: Retrieves detailed system information (like systeminfo in CMD).

Get-NetIPConfiguration: Shows network interface details (similar to ipconfig in CMD).

Get-LocalUser: Lists local user accounts (similar to net user in CMD).
