==============System Tools=============
- Task Scheduler
Per Microsoft, with Task Scheduler, we can create and manage common tasks that our computer 
will carry out automatically at the times we specify.

-  Event Viewer
Event Viewer allows us to view events that have occurred on the computer. These records of events can be seen as an audit trail
that can be used to understand the activity of the computer system. This information is often used to diagnose problems and investigate
actions executed on the system.

Disk Management is a system utility in Windows that enables you to perform advanced storage tasks.  Some tasks are:
Set up a new drive
Extend a partition
Shrink a partition
Assign or change a drive letter (ex. E:) 

============Services and Applications===========
Recall from the previous task, a service is a special type of application that runs in the background.
The services shown above have their display names, status, and other values. 
If you want to get more information about any service, right-click on the service and click properties.
Here, you will see additional details, such as the service name (which differs from the display name),
the path to its executable, its startup type, and other relevant information.
